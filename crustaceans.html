        <p>
            Crustaceans are a very diverse group of invertebrate animals wich 
            includes some animals such as lobsters, crabs, shrimp, etc. The crustacean
            group can be treated as a subphylum under the clade mandibulata. It's now 
            well accepted that the hexapods emerged deep in the crustacean group, with 
            the completed group reffered to as Pancrustaceans. Crustaceans have an exoskeleton, 
            which they moult to grow. Most of the crustaceans are free-living aquatic animals, 
            but some of them are terrestrial, parasitic, and some of them are sessile.
